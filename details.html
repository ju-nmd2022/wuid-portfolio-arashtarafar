            <div class="project-facet-detail">
                <img src="media/img/project_display.png" alt="">
                <p>The desired outcomes for this project were complete client and server packages, along with full documentation and usage guide. The system was meant to be efficient and intuitive, for use by any office manager, teacher, assistant or student. The wireless functionality had to be designed in a way that the devices could connect to any available wireless network and still work seamlessly together.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Client firmware</h2>
            <div class="project-facet-detail">
                <img src="media/img/project_readFunc.png" alt="">
                <p>Firmwares for the client devices included functions for reading fingerprints, storing data in device memory and retrieving it, connecting to wireless networks and downloading list and biometrics data from the servers. Custom libraries were made to compensate for the lack of functionality in sensors' base firmware and for facilitating retrieval processes. Written in C++ within the ArduinoIDE enviromnent.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Server code</h2>
            <div class="project-facet-detail">
                <img src="media/img/project_serverCode.png" alt="">
                <p>Servers for the system were designed to be multithreaded in order to support arbitrary numbers of client devices, included list management functions, MySQL database retrieval and push functions and were written purely in C++ within the Qt environment.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Prototype packaging</h2>
            <div class="project-facet-detail">
                <img src="media/img/project_fingerprint.png" alt="">
                <p>Initial prototype packaging was designed using Blender CAD software, taking into account functionality, accessiblity and quality-of-life. Designs were then handed to a professional workshop to be cut out of Plexiglas and attached together.</p>
